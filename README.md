# page-migration-simulator
Simulator for page migration between local and remote memories, with page migration based on novel method for finding hotness of pages in remote memory, and LRU for victim page selection in local memory. 


Hotness of  a page based on both the recency and frequency of accesses.


hot_new = 1 + d * hot_old, 


where hot_new is the new hotness of the page, hot_old is the old hotness of the page, and d is the decay coefficient which will decrease as the page accesses become older. This would decrease the importance of old accesses in the current hotness. d for a page will be calculated as:


d = hot_old / ( hot_old +( (global_access_count - global_access_count_till_last_access)/total_pages_in_memory) ). 


hot_old is the old hotness of the page, global_access_count is the total number of accesses in the memory till now, and global_access_count_till_last_access is the total number of accesses till the last access to the page.


Thus,  (global_access_count - global_access_count_till_last_access)/total_pages_in_memory roughly gives us the number of cycles of accesses to the memory since the page under consideration was last accessed.
For victim page selection, traditional LRU based approach is used.

Size of the hotness-table is fixed, so the hotness detection algorithm can be implemented in the remote memory controller without any significant overhead.

Page migration done on a fixed page migration epoch, where the central memory manager will request hot pages from the remote memory controller, and victim pages from local memory, and perform page migration between the memories.
